# My Journey with Python
Welcome. Don't know how you got here, but welcome! 
I'm a beginner with understanding coding. This repository is where I'm keeping all of my learning so that I can look back on it to see my progress whenever I feel discouraged. 

This repository will contain:
- notes
- learning projects
- projects

Currently I use Visual Studio Code to help push and pull files.

---

### Notes
Exactly what it means. Mainly .md files of my notes while I study. 

### Learning Projects
These are small projects that are pushed by learning websites, courses, schools, etc. 
Each individual project is its own file.

Currently includes projects/learning material from:
- Codeacademy
- The Odin Project (TOP)
- Youtube Walkthroughs

### Projects
Finished personal projects.

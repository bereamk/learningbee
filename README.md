# My Journey with Python
Welcome. Don't know how you got here, but welcome! 
I'm a beginner with understanding coding. This repository is where I'm keeping all of my learning so that I can look back on it to see my progress whenever I feel discouraged. 

This repository will contain:
- chatGPT (based learning)
- notes
- learning projects
- projects

Currently I use Visual Studio Code to help push and pull files.

### ChatGPT based learning
For better or for worse... at least it doesn't get annoyed with me asking dumb questions.
ChatGPT has been a great tool for me to build on my understanding and grasp concepts.
These are basically practice runs with coding that will be mainly comment based after I've run them through my own terminal. Fun to keep these notes to reference back.

### Notes
Exactly what it means. Mainly .md files of my notes while I study. 

### Learning Projects
These are small projects that are pushed by learning websites, courses, schools, etc. 
Each individual project is its own file.

Currently includes projects/learning material from:
- Codeacademy
- The Odin Project (TOP)
- Youtube Walkthroughs

### Projects
Finished personal projects.

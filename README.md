# My Learning Journey
Welcome. Don't know how you got here, but welcome! 
I'm dipping my toe into the coding/programming world. This repository is where I'm keeping all of my learning so that I can look back on it to see my progress whenever I feel discouraged. 

This repository will contain:
- notes
- learning
- projects

Currently I use Visual Studio Code to help push and pull files.

## Notes
Exactly what it means. Mainly .md files of my notes while I study. 

## Learning
As I learn new technologies and techniques, I often work on small-scale projects and exercises (this includes my academic work).
<br>
Each individual learning platform/method has its own folder and files within.

Currently includes learning material from:
- Codeacademy
- The Odin Project (TOP)
- University
- Youtube Tutorials

## Projects
Finished personal projects.

# My Learning Journey
Welcome. Don't know how you got here, but welcome! 
I'm dipping my toe into the coding/programming world. This repository is where I'm keeping all of my learning so that I can look back on it to see my progress whenever I feel discouraged. 

This repository will contain:
- challenges
- learning_projects
- notes
- projects
- uni

Currently I use Visual Studio Code to help push and pull files.

---

## Challenges
I'm part of multiple discords and sometimes these discords will post coding challenges. Any of the ones I've attempted/completed are in this folder.

## Learning_projects
As I learn new technologies and techniques, I often work on small-scale projects and exercises.
<br>
Each individual learning platform/method has its own folder and files within.

Currently includes learning material from:
- Codeacademy
- The Odin Project (TOP)
- Youtube Tutorials

## Notes
Exactly what it means. Mainly .md files of my notes while I study. 

## Projects
Finished personal projects.
